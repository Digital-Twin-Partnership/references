| [Use Case Scenarios for Digital Twin Implementation Based on ISO 23247](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ams/NIST.AMS.400-2.pdf) | As a key part of digital transformation, digital twin is an important concept for achieving smart manufacturing. However, there remains many challenges about the digital twin concept and how it can be implemented in real manufacturing systems, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises. Relevant standards that provide common terminology and implementation guidelines can help address these challenges. This paper discusses the concept, definitions, applications, and recent standardization efforts of digital twins. In particular, International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/Draft International Standard (DIS) 23247, Digital Twin Framework for Manufacturing, is introduced. The scenarios of three digital-twin use cases in manufacturing are explored in depth and the procedures of implementing such use cases according to the ISO/DIS23247 framework are presented. The designs of these use case scenarios can be implemented at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Smart Manufacturing Systems (SMS) Test Bed or on any manufacturing shop floor that has similar maturity level of digital transformation. In addition, the procedures of design and implementation of ISO/DIS 23247 can be used for developing additional applications of digital twins in manufacturing. | [Use Case Scenarios for Digital Twin Implementation Based on ISO 23247](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ams/NIST.AMS.400-2.pdf) |

| [ISO 37106:2021 Sustainable cities and communities](https://www.iso.org/standard/82854.html)        | This document gives guidance for leaders in smart cities and communities (from the public, private and voluntary sectors) on how to develop an open, collaborative, citizen-centric and digitally-enabled operating model for their city that puts its vision for a sustainable future into operation. This document does not describe a one-size-fits-all model for the future of cities. Rather, the focus is on the enabling processes by which innovative use of technology and data, coupled with organizational change, can help each city deliver its own specific vision for a sustainable future in more efficient, effective and agile ways. This document provides proven tools that cities can deploy when operationalizing the vision, strategy and policy agenda they have developed following the adoption of ISO 37101, the management system for sustainable development of communities. It can also be used, either in whole or in part, by cities that have not committed to deployment of the ISO 37101 management system.                                                                                                   | [ISO 37106:2021 Sustainable cities and communities — Guidance on establishing smart city operating models for sustainable communities](https://www.iso.org/standard/82854.html)                           |

The framework describes the planning, development, operation and maintenance methodology to facilitate the harmonization of each infrastructure as a part of a smart community and ensures that the interactions between multiple infrastructures are well orchestrated. The framework is applicable to all processes of smart community infrastructures' life cycle (from conceptual design through planning, development, operation, maintenance, redevelopment and feedback). The infrastructures to be covered are energy, water, transportation, waste management, ICT and others. The framework can be adopted by all relevant stakeholders who are engaged in planning, development and operation of smart community infrastructures, including planners, developers, business operators and suppliers. The framework is intended to cover the processes in which these stakeholders are engaged, such as management, organizational structure, analyses and design methods, and documentations. | [ISO/TR 37152:2016 Smart community infrastructures — Common framework for development and operation](https://www.iso.org/standard/66898.html)                                                             |
